Code for an event based solution of front propagation with a random distribution of circular hotspots (zones of higher velocity propagation)

input parameter file structure (param.in):

nread (int)
etas,edump,etam (float, float, float)
vmean (float)
nsim (int)
tend, dt (float,float)
tdump (int)
lenx,leny (float,float)
vf,robs (float,float)

Parameter explanation:
nread=1 the code read the positions of the hotspots from a list of file with name "position_highdif_areas.me.*.isample.0.dat"> In this case the velocity outside and inside the hotposts are set to be:
  vf = 0.0073; (background)
  vr = 0.0282; (hotspot)
nread=0 the code generates hotspots at random positions. In this case the velocity outsdie and inside the hotspots are set to vmean-eta and vmean+eta.
etas,edump,etam: # 3 parameters to define the list of eta values in the code in the for loop for(eta=etas;eta<etam;eta=eta+edump)
vmean: arithmetic mean of the 2 velocities
nsim is the number of realizations with different hotspots distribution. The simulations are run one after the other, use mpi to run them parallel. nsim simulations * processor 
tend=total time
dt=time step.
tdump: dump the output data every tdump time steps
lenx: size of the domain along x
leny: size of the domain along y
vf: volume fraction, actually surface fraction in 2D. Number of hotspot is then imposed as Nhot = floor(-log(1.0-volumef)*lenx*leny/pi/robs/robs);
robs: radius of the hotspot


available flags in the Makefile:
MPI to run with mpi. In this case 1 realization per processor
DEBUG for debug mode compilation
PERFECT considers the case of infinite filling time of the hotspot.

compile with 'make'
run the code with 'mpirun event_model' or './event_model' for a single processor (MPI OFF)
