Code for an event based solution of front propagation with a random distribution of circular hotspots (zones of higher velocity propagation)


Used in the publication "The collective effect of finite-sized inhomogeneities on the spatial spread of populations in two dimensions" by Wolfram Moebius, Francesca Tesser, Kim M. J. Alards, Roberto Benzi, David R. Nelson, and Federico Toschi (Fig4D)

input parameter file structure (param.in):

nread (int)
etas,edump,etam (float, float, float)
vmean (float)
nsim (int)
tend, dt (float,float)
tdump (int)
lenx,leny (float,float)
Nhs,robs (int,float)

Parameter explanation:
nread=1 the code read the positions of the hotspots from a list of file with name "position_highdif_areas.me.*.isample.0.dat"> In this case the velocity outside and inside the hotposts are set to be:
  vf = 1.4405; (background)
  vr = 3.5; (hotspot) 
nread=0 the code generates hotspots at random positions. In this case the velocity outsdie and inside the hotspots are set to vmean-eta and vmean+eta.
etas,edump,etam: # 3 parameters to define the list of eta values in the code in the for loop for(eta=etas;eta<etam;eta=eta+edump)

.  
vmean: arithmetic mean of the 2 velocities
nsim is the number of realizations with different hotspots distribution. The simulations are run one after the other, use mpi to run them parallel. nsim simulations * processor 
tend=total time
dt=time step.
tdump: dump the output data every tdump time steps
lenx: size of the domain along x
leny: size of the domain along y
Nhs: number of hotspots
robs: radius of the hotspot


available flags in the Makefile:
MPI to run with mpi. In this case 1 realization per processor
DEBUG for debug mode compilation
FISHER_ZERO is the case of background velocity =0

compile with 'make'
run the code with 'mpirun event_model' or './event_model' for a single processor (MPI OFF)
